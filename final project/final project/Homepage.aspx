          <h3 style="font-weight:100;">Lesson lounge is the place for you to learn new things and expand your knowledge. <br /><br /> The ever-growing supply of new members and teachers makes it always a good time to learn a new thing <br /> <br /> Here at Study Lounge, we believe emotional and social success is just as necessary as academic. That’s why we <br /> <br /> encourage and help kids to build the skills they need by giving them a safety net—not a crutch—as they learn to <br /> <br /> navigate their way towards independence.

Study Lounge is the new and cool way to learn,<br /> <br /> and we’re so excited to help your child succeed in all areas of life.</h3>
